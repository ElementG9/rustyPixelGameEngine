# rustyPixelGameEngine
A port of olcPixelGameEngine to Rust, a tool used in javidx9's YouTube videos and projects. I've kept the original license and the link to documentation is straight to the official project.

# About me
* Fairly experienced, self-taught, C++ hobbyist programmer.
* Turned to Rust because -
  * Error messages usually make sense
  * Package management is easy
  * It makes you program in a way that is performance oriented
  * Its fast
* Why port to a different language
  * Why not
  * I like to understand the algorithms, rewriting them helps
  * I love C++, but hate the tools

# Goals
* Obtain close to feature parity with PGE
* Beat PGE's speed (I will cheat ðŸ˜‰)
* Try to stay close to the API style of PGE, but I will stray if it makes sense

# Differences
* Many things may not be implemented.
* I don't use SDL, I use a Rust crate called [minifb](https://github.com/emoon/rust_minifb) to handle the window creation and event code.
* Debug mode is painfully slow, this is mostly a Rust problem
* I include some extra folders that can be ignored
  * .cargo - contains a cargo config file I use to test for speed.
  * .vscode - a couple json files used with VSCode

# Use
* Install latest [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* cargo run --example exteniontestgfx2d
